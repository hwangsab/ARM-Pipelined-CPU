# ARM-Pipelined-CPU

This repository contains the implementation of a 64-bit ARM CPU with pipelining. The CPU is designed to execute the same instructions as in Project 3, with the addition of a delay slot after each load and branch instruction. The implementation also includes data forwarding logic to ensure proper data dependencies between instructions.
